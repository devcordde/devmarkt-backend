# ðŸ’¸ Devmarkt-Backend

Devmarkt Backend of the Devmarkt-Rework

## Goal of this project

This project stands in connection with the devmarkt rework, which is a full rework of the current
devmarkt created by the devcord discord server.

This rework of its backend want to be more feature-rich and more maintainable.

## Features and structure

The Devmarkt-Backend is divided into 4 main parts:

System.out.println("Bla");

- [Templates](#templates)
- [Applications](#applications)
- [History](#history)
- [Management](#management)

### Templates

Templates are a collection of questions, identified by a unique name.

### Applications

Applications are answered templates by a user.

#### Application Service

The application service (endpoints and event) is a service, that stores the current application of a
user. This application is either waiting for processing by a mod or is in revision mode.

If the application is accepted, it will move to the history and will be immutable.

### History

The History stores all application of a user, identified by its timestamp.

It also contains actions to delete an application, but this is not guaranteed to be done on client
side.

### Management

The management service provides some admin actions like:

- fetch/delete all data of a user
- block/unblock a user from creating application

## Usage

## Module information

The `backend` module contains the main application of this backend. The `dto_common` module contains
some DTOs for the Rest API and events.
